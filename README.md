## About the Project

Rancid Tomatillos is a web application that allows the user to browse a selection of movies. The user can click on any one of the movies to view more details about that particular movie. The user also has the option of searching for a particular movie by title or genre. Once the user selects a movie, and goes to the movies details page, a trailer automatically loads so they can get a good feel for that movie. 

The details of this project are outlined in the [project spec](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/rancid-tomatillos-v3.html)

## Learning Goals

* Eli Davidson:
    1. React components.
    1. Cypress.
    1. Acync functions.
    1. Conditonal rendering.

* Nathan Hodnett:
    1. React component structure.
    1. Class components vs functional components.
    1. Cypress testing.
    1. Router.

## Project Evolution
Origionally, we wanted to create genre carousels on the main page, but ran out of time; so, we removed that idea from the MVP, and plan to add it in a future iteration. 

Also, we changed our component structure as the iterations progressed, from class to function and then back again, as the functionality needs of those components became clear.

## Project Reflections
>what didn't work, what did we learn?

* Eli Davidson:
1. React is all about timing. We learned a lot about watching what informaiton/data was in state during rendering, and how to ensure all data ended up in state by the time the component needed to access it. 

* Nathan Hodnett:
1. Cypress tests were also heavily timing dependent this envolved us adjusting timing / adding wait in order to run the tests successfully.
## Extensions
For this project we chose to complete the "More React Functionality" CYOA. In particular we added search/filtering functionality to the movies.

### Future Goals
1. Genre based carousels.
1. Error handle "Youtube video not available" 
1. Favorites functionality.
1. Deploy using Heroku.
1. Responsive CSS for Movie cards.
